    <p>Soon, the public conversation could be entirely or partially generated by AI, according to a report by Europol. But are we ready to accept language models as participants in our democracy?</p>
    <p>We aim to explore this question by letting two language models take part in a debate about their own regulation and the spread of misinformation online. These models are not polite or helpful like ChatGPTâ€”they have been trained by researchers at DTU to express sharp opinions that encourage the audience to reflect on the future of democracy in a digital society.</p>
