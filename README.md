# How to add a lab note? 📝

## 1. Create a New Project File
   - Go to the `Projects` folder
   - Create a new file clicking add file on the top Right corner and named after your project. Use simple words with hyphens, like `my-new-project.js`)
   - Remember to use the ending (.js) to your project file
   - Copy and paste this text template into your new file and edit the text:

   ```javascript
   //Project tile
   const noteData = {
     title: "YOUR PROJECT TITLE",
     date: "DD.MM.YYYY", // Use this date format
     image: "Assets/Test.png", // Put your image in the Assets folder
     preview: "A brief description of your project...",
     researchTopics: [
       "Topic 1",
       "Topic 2",
       "Topic 3"
     ],
     objectives: "What you want to achieve with this project",
     methodology: "How you plan to do it or how you did it",
     lessons: [
       "What you learned 1",
       "What you learned 2",
       "What you learned 3"
     ],
     collaborators: [
       "Person 1",
       "Person 2",
       "Person 3"
     ],

// Add your links
   projectLink: "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/", // Source link 1
   projectLinkText: "Framework Documentation", // Button text 1
   publicationLink: "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/", // Source link 2
   publicationLinkText: "Download Guidelines", // Button text 2

// OPTIONAL: Change section titles (right column)
     sectionTitles: {
       topics: "Research Areas",
       lessons: "Key Learnings",
       collaborators: "Team Members"
     }
   };
   ```

## **2. Add Your Project Image**
   - Put your project image in the `Assets` folder. You can go to the folder assets and click upload new.
   - Make sure to use the correct image path in your project file:
     
```javascript
     image: "Assets/Test.png", // Put your image in the Assets folder and copy the name here
```

## **3. Add links to the lab note**: You can add links to the lab notes and change the text of the link button.

```javascript
// Add your links
      Link1: "https://your-project-link.com",
      LinkText1: "View Project",
      Link2: "https://your-publication-link.com",
      LinkText2: "Read Publication",
```

## **4. Save your project by clicking the green button - Commit changes**
   -Your project file should now appear under the project folder.

## **5. Update the Project List**
   - Open `Projects/project-list.json`
   - Add your project name (without the .js) to the list
   - Example: `"projects": ["existing-project-1", "existing-project-2", "my-new-project"]`
   - The order of the list will determine how the lab notes apear in the main website.
     
### **Optional: Editing Style the Text of the Section Headings**

This is not essential for your project to appear, but you might want different section headings (e.g. methodology, collaborators, etc.)

You can control how the text appears in each section:

*For Bullet points: Use an array*

   ```javascript
   lessons: [
  "What you learned 1",
  "What you learned 2"
]
  ```
   
*For Paragraphs: Use a string with p tags*

   ```javascript
objectives: "<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>" "<p>This is another piece of text.</p>" 
  ```

*For Single-line text: Use a plain string*

   ```javascript   
title: "My Project Title"
 ```

*Optional: Change Section Titles*: If you'd like to customize the section headings the right column, you can edit this part of the code:

   ```javascript
  sectionTitles: {
    topics: "Research Areas",
    lessons: "Key Learnings",
    collaborators: "Team Members"
  }
} 
 ```


## ✅ Final Checklist for uploading projects:

 - Create a new project file in the Projects/ folder?
 - Use a clear and simple filename (like my-new-project.js)?
 - Fill in all the fields in the noteData object (title, date, image, etc.)?
 - Upload your image to the Assets/ folder?
 - Use the correct path to the image in your project file (Assets/your-image.png)?
 - Add your project name (without .js) to the project-list.json file?

If you have any problems try asking Johan, Sarah or Ainoa. 
Your LAB note should now be on the Echo Lab website :) 

### PLEASE NOTE: It might take 5 minutes for GitHub to process your edit. 
Do not be confused if it takes a bit of time until your lab note appears on the website.
